v1.16
	PUNVoice:
CHANGED: removed all RequestUserAuthorization calls: crashes iOS builds, useful only in WebPlayer which is not supported since Unity 5.4.0
CHANGED: PhotonVoiceRecorder.updateAudioSource renamed to UpdateAudioSource and made public (call it when AudioSourceFactory has changed e.g.), it recreates local voice for any audio source (was Microphone only)
CHANGED: PhotonVoiceCreated receiver parameter updated in DelayProcessor
CHANGED: PhotonVoiceSettings.Encrypt option added to toggle encryption of all voice streams from settings
CHANGED: PhotonVoiceSettings.WorkInOfflineMode option added to allow voice client to connect in PUN offline mode
CHANGED: when connecting to self hosted server PUN's Nickname and UserId are used
CHANGED: updated Standard Assets' CrossPlatformInput inside PhotonVoice to remove warnings from newer Unity versions
CHANGED: updated PUN to 1.91v
CHANGED: PhotonVoiceSpeaker routes audio data to IAudioOut instance instead of AudioStreamPlayer; AudioStreamPlayer implements IAudioOut
ADDED: PS4AudioOut component that implements IAudioOut used in PS4 builds. 
NOTE: Audio output on the PS4 is now routed through Sony's native audio output APIs instead of through Unity's audio output APIs, when headphones are connected. This change was necessary to be able to support Sony's requirement that Voice Chat audio output must go to the headphones (when such are connected) even when other audio output goes to the speakers (which is not currently supported by Unity's audio output APIs).
	PhotonVoiceAPI:
FIXED: VoiceClient.removePlayerVoices iterated local voices channels list instead of remote
MINOR: not used 'encoder' parameter removed from VoiceClient.createLocalVoice (encoder passed implicitly in voiceFactory parameter if required)
CHANGED: VoiceClient.RemoveLocalVoice made public
FIXED: LocalVoiceFramed.PushDataBufferPool.Release always called with 'info' parameter to avoid reusing of buffers of wrong size during pool element size change with Init call (this happens for windows AudioIn native capturer e.g.) 
CHANGED: LocalVoice.IsTransmitting set to true if sendFrame was called in PushData or service (for readers) calls instead of checking built-in threshold based voice detector status
ADDED: AudioUtil::ForceToStereo()

CHANGED: PUN updated to 1.90v
FIXED: Photon Voice's "AutoConnect" and "AutoDisconnect" settings ignored when PUN's "OfflineMode" is enabled

v1.14
    PUNVoice:
CHANGED: UWP build fixes
CHANGED: the PS4 output implementation is now mixing the output of all PhotonVoiceSpeaker.cs instances and passing them to the same PS4 audio output port instead of opening a new port per instance because the Sony PS4 audio output APIs don't support more than 4 parallely opened voice output ports
CHANGED: refactored the PhotonVoiceSpeaker cleanup code to get rid of code redundancies
FIXED: Singleton pattern for PhotonVoiceNetwork and PhotonVoiceSettings
CHANGED: PhotonVoiceRecorder passes IAudioSource along with LocalVoice to PhotonVoiceCreated message

v1.91
FIXED: issue with missing files by renaming compile condition ENABLE_VIDEO to PHOTON_VOICE_VIDEO_ENABLE.
FIXED: issue in PhotonVoiceHandler due to Profiler namespace change in Unity 5.5+.
UPDATED: CrossPlatformInput StandardAsset to remove warnings in latest Unity versions.

v1.9
  PUNVoice:
CHANGED: PUN updated to v1.84
ADDED: PhotonVoiceHandler to implements a fallback thread that keeps sending ACKs when in background (Android) or keeps service loop when loading scenes.
CHANGED: AudioClipWrapper.cs, AudioStreamPlayer.cs, MicWrapper.cs moved from Assets/PUNVoice/Scripts folder to Assets/Plugins/PhotonVoiceApi/Platforms/Unity
  PhotonVoiceAPI:
CHANGED: Voice peer sends sudio packets in channel 1 to not interfere with user data being sent in channel 0 by default
CHANGED: encoding and decoding moved to separate threads

v1.8
CHANGED: PUN updated to v1.79
FIXED: when player left a room, VoiceClient.removePlayerVoices tried to remove player voices from wrong container

FIXED: AudioStreamPlayer: previous buffer tail played back on stream resume 
CHANGED: iOS library rebuilt with full bitcode (Archive menu used in xcode)

v1.7
  PUNVoice:
CHANGED: PUN updated to v1.76
BREAKING: Opus Delay replaced with Photon.Voice.FrameDuration in PhotonVoiceSettings
(If non-default Delay was used, updating new FrameDuration setting required)

CHANGED: VoiceClient.UseLossCompensation property removed
FIXED: voice now works on self hosted when PUN is using TCP, different ports per app
FIXED: AudioStreamPlayer: assigning negative values to playSamplePos caused AudioSource position setting error
FIXED: AudioStreamPlayer buffer size set precisely basing on frame size and delay values (+1 sec) or it could be too small for high delays
FIXED: setting PhotonVoiceRecorder.Transmit to PhotonVoiceSettings.AutoTransmit moved to Start() from OnJoinedVoiceRoom() or it's skipped if PhotonVoiceRecorder created after joining a room
CHANGED: PushToTalk demo now exposes change of audio group using binary group chat
  VoiceClient (accessible via PhotonVoiceNetwork.Client):
ADDED: LocalVoice FramesSent, FramesSentBytes 
ADDED: VoiceClient FramesSent, FramesSentBytes, RoundTripTime, RoundTripTimeVariance properties (rtt calculated only if local voices echoed back)
CHANGED: memory allocation and buffer copying optimizations
CHANGED: loss compensation is always on (synchronization relies on it)
BREAKING: VoiceClient.UseLossCompensation property removed

v1.6
CHANGED: updated to PUN 1.75
FIXED: iOS IPv6 support

v1.5
CHANGED: updated to PUN 1.74
FIXED: Crash of iOS application exported from Unity 5.3.6+ (opus library exposes only interface methods now)

FIXED: manually created PhotonVoiceNetwork instance got destroyed on scene change leaving PUNVoice w/o singleton (now PhotonVoiceNetwork singleton is created independently of accidentally added in editor PhotonVoiceNetwork instances, non-singleton instances disabled because all methods return immediately)
FIXED: voice != null checks in PhotonVoiceRecorder's Transmit and Detect properties
