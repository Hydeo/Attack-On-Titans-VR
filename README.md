Attack On Titans VR Tribute game

This project has been build within a week as a personal challenge. 
The aim was to start playing around with VR developement and have a first contact with game design and technical challenges one faces when producing such a thing.

In a few words :
- Recreation of the AOT experience (3 Dimensional Maneuver Gear, Huge titans, Gaz propulsion)
- Multiplayer with Photon
- VR interaction with VRTK 3.3
